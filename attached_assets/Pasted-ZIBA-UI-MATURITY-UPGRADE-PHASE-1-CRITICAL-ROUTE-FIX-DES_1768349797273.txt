ZIBA UI MATURITY UPGRADE — PHASE 1
CRITICAL ROUTE FIX + DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION

CONTEXT:
- App name: Ziba
- This is the RIDER APP
- Current bug: After clicking "Complete Trip", user sees a 404 page
- Goal: Fix routing + upgrade UI maturity to Uber-level polish
- Platform: Web app (mobile-first), Android & iOS wrapper later

========================
PART A — FIX 404 AFTER COMPLETE TRIP (MANDATORY)
========================

1. Ensure the Trip Summary route EXISTS and is REGISTERED in the router.

Required route:
- Path: /rider/trip-summary/:tripId
- Component: RiderTripSummaryPage

2. When "Complete Trip" is clicked:
   - Finalize trip in backend
   - Receive tripId from completion response
   - Navigate using:
     navigate(`/rider/trip-summary/${tripId}`)

3. Remove ALL of the following if they exist:
   - /trip-summary
   - /rider/trip-summary (without :tripId)
   - Any duplicate or legacy TripSummary routes

4. Ensure route order:
   - /rider/trip-summary/:tripId MUST be declared before any wildcard or 404 route

5. Trip Summary page must:
   - Fetch trip by tripId
   - Gracefully handle loading & missing data
   - NEVER show a blank page or 404 if trip exists

Expected result:
✔ Clicking “Complete Trip” ALWAYS lands on Trip Summary
✔ No router error
✔ No white screen
✔ No 404

========================
PART B — DEFINE ZIBA DESIGN SYSTEM (FOUNDATION)
========================

Create a Ziba Design System and apply it to ALL Rider screens.

COLORS (USE CONSISTENTLY):
- Primary: Ziba Blue (#0B5ED7)
- Primary Dark: #084298
- Accent (Success): #198754
- Accent (Warning/Test Mode): #F59E0B
- Danger: #DC3545
- Background: #F8FAFC
- Surface/Card: #FFFFFF
- Border: #E5E7EB
- Text Primary: #111827
- Text Secondary: #6B7280

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Font family: Inter, system-ui, sans-serif
- H1 (Screen title): 20–22px, semibold
- Section title: 14–16px, medium
- Body text: 14px, regular
- Caption/meta: 12px, muted
- Buttons: 14px, semibold

GLOBAL UI RULES:
- Rounded corners: 12px cards, 10px buttons
- Shadows: subtle, modern (no heavy shadows)
- Padding: consistent 16px blocks
- Touch targets: minimum 44px height
- Mobile-first layout ONLY

========================
PART C — START WITH RIDER HOME UI (FIRST SCREEN)
========================

Upgrade Rider Home to look mature, clean, and professional:

Home layout:
1. Greeting card:
   - “Hello, {First Name}”
   - Soft background, no harsh borders

2. Primary action card:
   - Title: “Where are you going?”
   - Destination input styled as a large pill
   - Clear arrow icon

3. Wallet card:
   - Wallet balance displayed clearly
   - Uses Ziba Blue accent
   - Clickable

4. Recent Trips:
   - Card list with subtle dividers
   - Location + date + fare
   - “View all” link

5. Bottom navigation:
   - Home, Trips, Wallet, Profile
   - Active tab highlighted with Ziba Blue
   - Icons + labels

NO clutter
NO admin/test language on this screen

========================
PART D — FIX & POLISH RIDE STATUS SCREEN
========================

Upgrade Active Ride screens (Driver on the way, Arrived, In Progress):

Rules:
- One clear status headline
- Friendly human language
- Large status icon
- Driver card with:
  - Name
  - Rating
  - Vehicle plate
  - Call icon

Pickup & Drop-off:
- Clean timeline dots
- No cramped text

TEST MODE:
- Test controls must:
  - Be visually separated
  - Use warning color
  - Clearly labeled “TEST MODE”
  - Never look like production UI

Cancel Ride:
- Destructive button
- Clear spacing
- Red accent only for danger

========================
FINAL CHECK
========================

After implementation:
- Complete Trip → Trip Summary works
- Rider Home looks modern & calm
- Ride Status feels trustworthy
- App visually feels like a real transport product, not a prototype

Proceed carefully.
Do NOT add new features.
Fix routes first, then UI polish.
