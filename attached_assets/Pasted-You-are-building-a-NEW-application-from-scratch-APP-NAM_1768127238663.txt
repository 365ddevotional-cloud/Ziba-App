You are building a NEW application from scratch.

APP NAME:
Ziba

APP TYPE:
A ride-hailing / logistics platform (Uber-like), but this stage is FOUNDATION ONLY.

STAGE:
Stage 1 – Core Foundation & Authentication

DO NOT build ride matching, maps, payments, or driver logic yet.

TECH STACK (KEEP SIMPLE):
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- ORM: Prisma
- Auth: Email + Password (JWT + session)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Colors: Dark blue, white, soft gray (professional, Uber-like feel)

REQUIREMENTS (MUST ALL WORK):

1. ROUTES (NO 404s):
   - `/` → Ziba landing page
   - `/login` → User login
   - `/register` → User registration
   - `/admin/login` → Admin login
   - `/admin/setup` → First-time admin password setup
   - `/admin/dashboard` → Protected admin dashboard

2. ADMIN LOGIC (VERY IMPORTANT):
   - There is ONE initial admin created via environment variables:
     ADMIN_EMAIL
     ADMIN_PHONE
   - Admin has NO password initially
   - On first visit to `/admin/login`, redirect admin to `/admin/setup`
   - Admin sets password ONCE
   - After setup, admin is auto-logged in
   - Future visits go directly to `/admin/login`

3. AUTH RULES:
   - Users CANNOT access admin routes
   - Admin CANNOT log in via user login
   - Admin routes are protected
   - Sessions persist on refresh

4. DATABASE:
   - User table
   - Admin table
   - Passwords hashed
   - Prisma migrations applied cleanly

5. UI REQUIREMENTS:
   - Simple, clean pages
   - Clear labels
   - No placeholder junk
   - No broken links

6. OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
   When finished, I should be able to:
   - Open `/`
   - Register a user
   - Log in a user
   - Go to `/admin/login`
   - Be redirected to `/admin/setup`
   - Set admin password
   - See `/admin/dashboard`

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT reuse old Ziba code
- Do NOT create a monorepo
- Do NOT skip routes
- Do NOT leave TODO auth logic
- Do NOT show 404 on any listed route

If anything is unclear, make a reasonable decision and continue.
Build clean, minimal, and stable.
