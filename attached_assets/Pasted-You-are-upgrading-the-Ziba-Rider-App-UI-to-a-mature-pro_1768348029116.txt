You are upgrading the Ziba Rider App UI to a mature, professional, production-ready design.

GOAL:
Establish a consistent Ziba Design System (colors + typography), then refactor the Rider Home UI and Ride Status screen to match modern ride-hailing standards (Uber-class polish).

DO NOT add new features.
DO NOT change backend logic.
FOCUS ONLY on UI, UX, copy, and visual consistency.

--------------------------------
STEP 1: DEFINE ZIBA DESIGN SYSTEM
--------------------------------

Create a centralized design system file and enforce it across Rider screens.

COLORS:
- PrimaryColor: use Ziba brand primary color ONLY for:
  - Primary CTA buttons
  - Active ride status
  - Progress indicators
- BackgroundColor: light neutral (cards sit on this)
- CardColor: white or near-white
- TextPrimary: dark neutral (headings)
- TextSecondary: muted gray (supporting text)
- SuccessColor: soft green (ARRIVED, COMPLETED)
- DangerColor: muted red (Cancel only)

RULES:
- Never use bright colors for body text
- Never mix multiple accent colors on one screen
- No red/orange for non-critical states

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Headline (large, semibold): status titles and screen headers
- Body (regular): descriptions and instructions
- Caption (small): metadata like ETA, vehicle info

No decorative fonts.
No excessive bolding.
No inconsistent font sizes.

--------------------------------
STEP 2: FIX RIDE STATUS SCREEN (PRIORITY)
--------------------------------

Refactor the Ride Status screen UI ONLY.

STRUCTURE:
TOP:
- Large headline text showing human-readable status:
  Examples:
    "Driver on the way"
    "Driver has arrived"
    "Trip in progress"
    "Trip completed"

- Subtext below headline:
  Example: "Arriving in 3 minutes"

MIDDLE:
- Single clean card containing:
  - Driver name
  - Vehicle details
  - Rating
  - ETA

BOTTOM:
- One secondary action only:
  - "Cancel Ride" (DangerColor, subtle)

RULES:
- NEVER display internal state names (e.g. DRIVER_EN_ROUTE)
- NEVER show router, system, or developer error messages
- Smooth transitions between states
- Calm, reassuring language

--------------------------------
STEP 3: RIDER HOME UI FOUNDATION
--------------------------------

Refactor Rider Home screen to a clean, minimal layout.

LAYOUT:
TOP:
- Headline: "Where are you going?"

MIDDLE:
- Pickup location card
- Destination input card

BOTTOM:
- Single primary CTA button:
  "Request Ride"

RULES:
- No clutter
- No developer/test controls visible
- No multiple CTAs
- UI must feel simple, confident, and premium

--------------------------------
STEP 4: ERROR HANDLING (UI ONLY)
--------------------------------

Replace all visible technical errors with user-friendly messages.

FOR EXAMPLE:
Instead of:
"Did you forget to add the page to the router?"

Show:
"We’re having trouble loading this screen. Please try again."

Log technical details to console only.

--------------------------------
FINAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

- Apply the design system consistently
- Do not break navigation
- Do not introduce new routes
- UI must feel calm, modern, and trustworthy
- Output should be ready for Android and iOS

When finished, confirm:
- Ride Status screen is clean and readable
- Rider Home UI looks professional
- No technical text is visible to users
