You are continuing the EXISTING Ziba application.

DO NOT restart the app.
DO NOT remove completed features.
DO NOT add authentication or passwords.
DO NOT introduce external services.

STAGE:
Stage 7 – Roles & Governance (Preview Mode)

GOAL:
Introduce Directors as a first-class governance role and prepare the system
for future authentication without enforcing it yet.

--------------------------------
1. DATABASE – DIRECTOR MODEL
--------------------------------

Add a Director model (if not already added):

Director:
- id
- fullName
- email
- role (OPERATIONS | FINANCE | COMPLIANCE)
- region
- createdAt

NO relations yet.
NO passwords.
NO auth fields.

--------------------------------
2. SEED DATA
--------------------------------

Seed at least 3 Directors:
- Operations Director – Lagos
- Finance Director – National
- Compliance Director – Abuja

Ensure seeding does NOT affect existing seed data.

--------------------------------
3. ROLE AWARENESS (SOFT)
--------------------------------

Introduce a lightweight role concept:
- Admin
- Director

This is NOT authentication.
This is NOT permission enforcement.

Use simple flags or context to:
- Show Director-specific views
- Prepare routing structure

--------------------------------
4. UI – DIRECTORS
--------------------------------

Add:
- /directors → Directors list page (table view)
- Admin → Directors section
- Director overview page (read-only)

Columns:
- Name
- Role
- Region

--------------------------------
5. ACCESS BEHAVIOR (PREVIEW ONLY)
--------------------------------

For now:
- Everyone can view everything
- NO login required
- NO route blocking

But structure code so that:
- Directors are logically separated from Admin
- Admin has broader visibility than Director

--------------------------------
6. VERIFY
--------------------------------

Confirm:
- Directors appear in UI
- Admin dashboard shows Directors count
- No existing pages break
- No Prisma or console errors
- Preview works everywhere

STOP after completion.
DO NOT suggest next stages.
