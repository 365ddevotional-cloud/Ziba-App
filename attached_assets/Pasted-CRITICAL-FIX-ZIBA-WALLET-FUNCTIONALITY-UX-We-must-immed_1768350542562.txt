CRITICAL FIX — ZIBA WALLET FUNCTIONALITY & UX

We must immediately fix the Wallet screen behavior. Do NOT use placeholder “COMING SOON” states anymore.

OBJECTIVES (MANDATORY):

1. REMOVE ALL “COMING SOON” MESSAGES
   - Remove “Coming soon” banners from:
     - Add Funds
     - Add Card
     - Payment Methods
   - These features must NEVER block the user with a dead-end message.

2. MAKE ALL WALLET BUTTONS CLICKABLE WITH REAL FLOWS

Implement the following routes and behaviors:

A. ADD FUNDS
   - Button: “Add Funds”
   - Route: /rider/wallet/add-funds
   - Screen content:
     - Header: “Add Funds”
     - Input: Amount (number, NGN)
     - Payment method selector (Card | Bank Transfer | Wallet)
     - Button: “Proceed”
     - On submit:
       - Show confirmation screen
       - Message:
         “Thank you. Your funding request has been received.”
       - Log transaction as “Pending Funding”

B. ADD CARD
   - Button: “Add Card”
   - Route: /rider/wallet/add-card
   - Screen content:
     - Card Number
     - Expiry Date
     - CVV
     - Name on Card
     - Save Card button
   - On success:
     - Toast: “Card added successfully”
     - Save card to user profile

C. PAYMENT METHODS
   - Button: “Payment Methods”
   - Route: /rider/wallet/payment-methods
   - Screen content:
     - List saved cards
     - Bank account (if exists)
     - Default payment selector
     - Option to remove or change default

3. RECENT TRANSACTIONS — CLICKABLE DETAILS

- Each transaction item must be clickable
- Route: /rider/wallet/transaction/:id
- Transaction detail screen must show:
  - Transaction type (Ride / Withdrawal / Funding)
  - Amount
  - Date & time
  - Status (Completed / Pending)
  - Reference ID
  - Thank-you message:
    “Thank you for using Ziba. We appreciate your trust.”

4. UX RULES (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- No button should do nothing
- No screen should end without navigation
- No “under development” messages
- If backend logic is missing, simulate realistic responses
- Maintain Ziba brand colors and typography
- Keep transitions smooth and professional

5. VALIDATION

After implementation:
- Clicking every wallet button must navigate somewhere meaningful
- No “404 Page Not Found”
- No placeholder banners
- Wallet must feel production-ready, not demo-ready

Proceed step-by-step and confirm once all Wallet actions are functional.
