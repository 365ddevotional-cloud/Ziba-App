You are implementing the Notifications system for the Ziba ride-hailing platform.

GOAL:
Create a unified notification system that supports:
- In-app notifications
- Push-ready architecture (Firebase/Expo later)
- Admin announcements
- System alerts for rides, payments, ratings, and safety

--------------------------------
1. DATABASE MODEL
--------------------------------

Notification:
- id
- userId
- role: RIDER | DRIVER | ADMIN
- type:
  - RIDE_REQUEST
  - DRIVER_ASSIGNED
  - TRIP_STARTED
  - TRIP_COMPLETED
  - PAYMENT_HELD
  - PAYMENT_RELEASED
  - PAYOUT_SENT
  - RATING_RECEIVED
  - REPORT_STATUS
  - SYSTEM
  - ADMIN_ANNOUNCEMENT
- title
- message
- isRead (boolean)
- createdAt

--------------------------------
2. SERVER LOGIC (AUTO CREATE NOTIFICATIONS)
--------------------------------

Trigger notifications when:
- Driver is matched → DRIVER_ASSIGNED
- Trip starts → TRIP_STARTED
- Trip completes → TRIP_COMPLETED
- Fare held → PAYMENT_HELD
- Fare settled → PAYMENT_RELEASED
- Driver payout → PAYOUT_SENT
- Rating received → RATING_RECEIVED
- Report reviewed → REPORT_STATUS

--------------------------------
3. API ENDPOINTS
--------------------------------

GET /api/notifications
- Returns notifications for logged-in user
- Sorted newest first

POST /api/notifications/read
- Marks one or all notifications as read

POST /api/admin/announcement
- Admin-only
- Sends notification to:
  - All users
  - Riders only
  - Drivers only

--------------------------------
4. UI REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

Rider / Driver:
- Notification bell icon
- Unread badge count
- Click notification → deep link to relevant page

Admin:
- Announcement composer
- Notification history view

--------------------------------
5. SECURITY RULES
--------------------------------

- Users can only read their own notifications
- Admin announcements logged
- Notifications immutable after creation
- Push delivery optional (future-ready)

--------------------------------
END RESULT
--------------------------------

Ziba now has:
- In-app notifications
- System alerts
- Admin announcements
- Push-ready architecture
