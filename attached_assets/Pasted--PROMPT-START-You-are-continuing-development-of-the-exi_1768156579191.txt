📌 PROMPT START

You are continuing development of the existing Ziba application.

⚠️ DO NOT restart the project
⚠️ DO NOT refactor architecture
⚠️ DO NOT add authentication, payments, or external APIs
⚠️ DO NOT change existing routes or UI layouts

This stage is DATA SEEDING + VISUAL VERIFICATION ONLY.

APP CONTEXT

App Name: Ziba
Type: Ride-hailing / logistics platform
Current State:

UI pages exist for:

/users

/drivers

/rides

/admin

Database schema already exists

Prisma is installed and configured

App runs and previews correctly

Auth/passwords are intentionally disabled for now

STAGE 6 GOAL

Populate the database with safe, fake data so the app looks alive and all dashboards render meaningful content without requiring login.

TASKS (EXECUTE IN THIS ORDER)
1️⃣ CREATE A PRISMA SEED SCRIPT

Add a seed script that inserts:

USERS (5 total)

Fields: id, name, email, phone, status

Status mix:

3 ACTIVE

1 SUSPENDED

1 ACTIVE

DRIVERS (3 total)

Each driver must be linked to a user

Fields: vehicleType, plateNumber, status

Status mix:

1 APPROVED

1 PENDING

1 SUSPENDED

RIDES (10 total)

Each ride MUST be linked to:

a user

a driver (except REQUESTED rides)

Status mix:

REQUESTED

ACCEPTED

COMPLETED

CANCELLED

Include pickup & dropoff locations (simple strings)

Include timestamps

PAYMENTS

Only for COMPLETED rides

Fields: amount, status, linkedRideId

Status: PAID

INCENTIVES

Linked to drivers

Fields: amount, reason, linkedDriverId

At least 1 incentive per APPROVED driver

2️⃣ CONNECT SEED SCRIPT TO PRISMA

Add seed config to package.json

Ensure this command works without error:

npx prisma db seed

3️⃣ DO NOT TOUCH UI LOGIC

No UI redesign

No route changes

No guards

No auth

Pages must simply render seeded data

4️⃣ VERIFY VISUALLY

After seeding, confirm:

/users shows 5 users

/drivers shows 3 drivers with mixed statuses

/rides shows 10 rides with mixed statuses

Admin/dashboard stats reflect real counts

No console errors

No Prisma errors

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

When finished, report ONLY:

✅ Seed script created

✅ Prisma seed runs successfully

✅ Data visible on all pages

✅ No errors

DO NOT ask questions.
DO NOT suggest next stages.
STOP after confirmation.
