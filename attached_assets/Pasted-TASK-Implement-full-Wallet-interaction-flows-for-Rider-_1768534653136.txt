TASK: Implement full Wallet interaction flows for Rider accounts.

CONTEXT:
The Wallet page currently displays:
- Add Funds
- Add Card
- Payment Methods
But these buttons do nothing when clicked.

GOAL:
Make all three buttons functional, navigable, and populated with real UI states.

REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT SKIP):

1. ROUTES
Create the following routes:
- /rider/wallet/add-funds
- /rider/wallet/add-card
- /rider/wallet/payment-methods

Ensure routes are registered in the router (fix any “Did you forget to add the page to the router?” errors).

2. ADD FUNDS PAGE (/rider/wallet/add-funds)
UI:
- Amount input (number, NGN)
- Payment method selector (Wallet Card / Bank Transfer)
- Primary button: “Proceed to Payment”
- Secondary button: “Cancel” → returns to /rider/wallet

Logic:
- Validate amount > 0
- Mock payment success
- On success:
  - Increase wallet balance
  - Log transaction as “Top-Up”
  - Redirect back to /rider/wallet with success toast

3. ADD CARD PAGE (/rider/wallet/add-card)
UI:
- Card Number
- Expiry Date
- CVV
- Cardholder Name
- Save Card toggle
- Button: “Add Card”

Logic:
- Validate fields
- Mock card tokenization
- Save card to user profile
- Redirect to /rider/wallet/payment-methods

4. PAYMENT METHODS PAGE (/rider/wallet/payment-methods)
UI:
- List saved cards
- Wallet balance option
- Default payment selector
- Remove card option

Logic:
- Allow setting default payment method
- Prevent deleting last payment method
- Persist selection in user state

5. BUTTON WIRING (IMPORTANT)
On Wallet page:
- Add Funds → navigate to /rider/wallet/add-funds
- Add Card → navigate to /rider/wallet/add-card
- Payment Methods → navigate to /rider/wallet/payment-methods

6. UX & STYLE
- Use existing Ziba color system
- Keep dark theme
- Buttons must show loading + disabled states
- Show toast notifications for success/errors

7. SECURITY
- Rider-only access
- Redirect unauthenticated users to /login

8. NO BREAKING CHANGES
- Do not modify Admin, Driver, or Director flows
- Do not remove existing wallet balance logic

DELIVERABLE:
All Wallet buttons clickable, routed, populated, and visually complete.
No placeholders. No dead buttons.
